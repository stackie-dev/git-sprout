/// A checked-out file holds the blob *after* `.gitattributes` processing — CRLF
/// conversion, `ident`, `working-tree-encoding`, clean/smudge filters. Hashing the
/// source file and comparing it to the target blob oid would therefore reject every
/// converted path, which on a repo with `core.autocrlf=true` is every text file.
///
/// Git's own answer to "is this file an unmodified checkout of this oid?" is the index
/// stat cache, and it is the answer git acts on for every `status` and every `checkout`.
/// So if the source's entry is stat-clean and its oid is the blob we want, then the
/// source's bytes are what a checkout at the destination would write — conversions
/// included — provided the attributes governing the path are the same on both sides.
/// That last condition is checked separately, per subtree, by `poisoned_prefixes`.
///
/// # How far the stat cache is trusted
///
/// Exactly as far as git trusts it, and no further:
///
///   * Git compares whole-second mtime and ctime, size, inode, uid and gid. This does
///     the same, and does it regardless of what `core.checkStat` says, because a repo
///     configured to check less is a repo whose recorded stat data proves less.
///   * Entries flagged assume-unchanged, skip-worktree or intent-to-add are rejected
///     outright by `entry_can_stand_in`: each of those flags is git saying the stat data
///     does not describe the file on disk.
///   * Unmerged entries are rejected; they have no single checked-out content.
///
/// # The racily-clean window
///
/// A file written in the same second the index was written can be modified again inside
/// that same second and still stat identically, because mtime has one-second resolution
/// in the index. Git calls such an entry racily clean and re-reads the content instead of
/// trusting the stat. `Verdict::AskGit` is that case: the caller hands those few paths to
/// `git diff-files`, which re-reads them with the repository's filters applied and reports
/// the ones that really differ. Hashing them here would be wrong for exactly the reason
/// the whole rule is index-based — the working-tree bytes are not the blob bytes.
///
/// The window is not narrowed by us and must not be: git decides it, from the mtime it
/// recorded on the index file itself, and any smaller window would trust files git does
/// not.
